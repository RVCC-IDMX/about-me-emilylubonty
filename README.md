## Description
The About Me project's purpose is to allow users to develop their own portfolio style website. In each section different aspects of HTML and CSS are used to demonstrate the functionality of web development. 

**NavBar**

The navigation bar at the top demonstrates how attributed links can lead the user to the desired locations throughout the website. By linking a reference point within the code, a hyperlink can be created making it easier for the user to navigate the website. For example, clicking on the "Bio" option will lead to the biography section of the website. This section makes it easier for users to find what they are looking for rather than endlessly searching through the website. 

**Hero**

The hero of the About Me project focuses on the author's main biographical information. This section includes the name, location, and profile image. It is followed by the bio section which includes more personal details such as background information.
